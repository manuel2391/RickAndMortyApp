## Modules

This project is broken down into five modules:

1. `app`: The presentation module. It contains the screens implementation.

2. `domain`: A pure Kotlin module holding the business logic of the app. Use cases, models and abstract definitions of data sources reside in this module. It acts like a bridge between the `app` and the `data` module.

3. `data`: As its name suggests, this module is in charge of the data handling. It provides concrete implementations for data sources.

4. `common`: The purpose of this module is to group useful things that can be shared among projects. It holds non-android implementations.

5. `common-ui`: This module has the same purpose as the previous one, but it holds only android stuff â€“ e.g. custom views.
